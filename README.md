mister-neo
==========

A set of hadoop map-reduce (mister) tools and input formats for working with raw neo4j data files. 

These tools are very useful when working with a very large neo4j database and you need to extract an adjaceny or edge list file format for use in other tools like graphlab, graphchi, faunus, etc.
